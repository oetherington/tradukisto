# Tradukisto
## Generate Typescript types for SQL queries

Tradukisto is a tool for generating Typescript types for arbitrary SQL queries
based on the Schema of a live Postgres database, plus some basic templating
utilities.

### Disclaimer

This library is currently in early development and may contain bugs, incomplete
features, or breaking changes without notice. It is not yet production-ready and
should be used with caution. Use of this library is at your own risk. The author
accepts no responsibility for any data loss, corruption, or other damages that
may occur as a result of using this software. By using this library, you
acknowledge that you understand these risks.

## Installation

`npm install tradukisto --save-dev` or `yarn add tradukisto --dev`

## Usage

If your sql files are all located in, for instance, `src/lib/queries`, you can
generate Typescript types with `npx tradukisto src/lib/queries/**/*.sql` with
npm, or `yarn tradukisto src/lib/queries/**/*.sql`. The file path uses standard
glob syntax.

The connection string for your database must be in an environment variable
called `DATABASE_URL`. If you store your environment variables in a .env file
you can run Tradukisto using a tool such as
[env-cmd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/env-cmd):

```
npx env-cmd -X tradukisto src/lib/queries/**/*.sql
```

## SQL files

In general, your SQL files should start with a `@repo` declaration to name
the output. The repo name should start with an upper-case letter A-Z, followed
by 0 or more upper- or lower-case letters, numbers, or underscores:

```sql
@repo MyRepo
```

All SQL queries must be named by a `@query` declaration. The query name should
start with a lower-case letter a-z, followed by 0 or more upper- or lower-case
letters, numbers, or underscores:

```sql
-- @query getAllUsers
SELECT * FROM users
```

Arguments should be named and prefixed with a colon. Where possible, Tradukisto
will automatically infer the types of parameters, but you can also explicitly
cast the parameter to be sure:

```sql
-- @query getUserById
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :id::TEXT
```

Section of SQL that you wish to reuse may be defined using `@partial`. Note
that the replacement is text-based rather than AST-based.

```sql
-- @partial verifiedUsersFilter(user_table, confirmations_table)
user_table.verified IS TRUE AND confirmations_table.confirmed IS TRUE

-- @query getVerifiedUsers
SELECT u.*
FROM users u
JOIN user_confirmations uc ON u.id = uc.user_id
WHERE verifiedUsersFilter(u, uc)
```
